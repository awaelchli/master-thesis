	This section presents all experiments conducted on the deep learning model described above.
	The results shown here give useful insights that supplement the work of \cite{wang2017deepvo}.
	
	\section{Dataset Size and Dropout}
		We start by training the proposed model on the KITTI dataset on small subsequences of 25 frames. 
		Initially, the sequences are divided without overlap, that is, each video frame is part of exactly one subsequence.
		In addition, to simulate a dataset with more subsequences, the overlap is set to 20 frames (80\%). 
		This means that for each subsequence there is another that differs by 5 frames.
		Table~\ref{tbl:kitti-overlap-and-dropout} compares the test error for models trained with and without overlap.
		\begin{table}[tb]
			\small
			\begin{center}
				\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|c|}
					\hline
					Length 	& Overlap 	& Dropout	& Total 	& Rotation	& Translation	\\ \hline
					25		& 0			& 0			& 19.0293	& 0.4981	& 18.5312		\\ \hline
					25		& 20		& 0			& 16.5471	& 0.3913	& 16.1558		\\ \hline
					100		& 20		& 0			& 529.9459	& 39.8967	& 490.0493		\\ \hline
					100		& 80		& 0			& 313.1278	& 47.8437	& 265.2841		\\ \hline
					100 	& 5			& 0.5		& 376.7666	& 43.1578	& 333.6088		\\ \hline
				\end{tabular}
			\end{center}
			\caption[Experiments on KITTI: Overlap and dropout]

				 \label{tbl:kitti-overlap-and-dropout}}
		\end{table}
		After the same number of epochs, the test error is about 13\% lower for the model trained on overlapping sequences with a decrease of 21\% for rotation and 12\% for translation.
		The same experiment is repeated by training on sequences of 100 frames with overlap 20 vs. overlap 80. 
		% Total error decreases by about 40\%.
		The translation error decreases by almost 46\%, however, the rotation loss increases.
		A similar observation can be made when using dropout on the LSTM output (before the fully-connected layer), as seen in the last row of table~\ref{tbl:kitti-overlap-and-dropout}.
		From these experiments, we can conclude that sequence overlap and dropout have a positive impact on the generalization of translation estimates.
