	\section{Quaternions}
		Quaternions are four-dimensional numbers.
		They are an extension of the complex numbers\footnote{A more appropriate name is \emph{compound numbers}.\todo{disputable}}.
		Formally, a quaternion is defined as $\vectr{q} = w + \vectr{i}x + \vectr{j}y + \vectr{k}z$ where $w, x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\vectr{i},\vectr{j}$ and $\vectr{k}$ are the basis elements of the quaternion space.
		The  can also be written as a tuple $\vectr{q} = (w, x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^4$ by using the notation
		\begin{equation}
			\vectr{1} = 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				1 \\ 
				0 \\ 
				0 \\ 
				0
			\end{bmatrix},\quad
			\vectr{i} = 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				0 \\ 
				1 \\ 
				0 \\ 
				0
			\end{bmatrix},\quad
			\vectr{j} = 
			\begin{bmatrix}
				0 \\ 
				0 \\ 
				1 \\ 
				0
			\end{bmatrix},\quad
			\vectr{k} =
			\begin{bmatrix}
				0 \\ 
				0 \\ 
				0 \\ 
				1
			\end{bmatrix}.
		\end{equation}
		But quaternions are not just tuples of numbers. 
		They are equipped with a separate addition and multiplication.
		Addition is simply carried out element-wise, whereas multiplication makes use of the distributive rule and the property
		\begin{equation}
			\vectr{i}^2 = \vectr{j}^2 = \vectr{k}^2 = \vectr{i}\vectr{j}\vectr{k} = -1.
		\end{equation}
		The norm of a quaternion is defined as
		\begin{equation}
			\lVert \vectr{q} \rVert = \sqrt{w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2}.
		\end{equation}
		
		A very interesting subset of the quaternions are the unit quaternions. These are all the quaternions with $\lVert \vectr{q} \rVert = 1$. 
		The quaternions of this form describe 3D rotations and can be parameterized by
		\begin{equation}
			\cos\left(\tfrac{\theta}{2}\right) + 
			\sin\left(\tfrac{\theta}{2}\right) \left(a_1 \vectr{i} + a_2 \vectr{j} + a_3 \vectr{k}\right),
		\end{equation}
		where $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$ is the angle of rotation around a unit-length axis $\vectr{a} = (a_1, a_2, a_3) \in \mathbb{R}^3$.
		\todo{explain that quaternions are not unique representation of rotations, and that negative axis-angle is represented by the same quaternion}
